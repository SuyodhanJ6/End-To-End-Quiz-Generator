## Overview

The Project Template Generator Script is a handy tool designed to simplify the initial setup of your new projects. It automates the creation of directories and files commonly used in software development, helping you maintain a consistent project structure and save time on repetitive tasks.

## The structure is organized as follows:

- `.github/workflows/`: GitHub Actions workflow configuration files.
- `src/`: Source code directory containing Python modules for the deep learning model.
- `tests/`: Unit and integration test cases and test data.
- `configs/`: Configuration files, including `config.yaml` for model hyperparameters.
- `dvc.yaml`: Data version control configuration for managing dataset versions.
- `params.yaml`: Hyperparameters and configuration.
- `init_setup.sh`: Initialization script for setting up the project.
- `requirements.txt`: Python package dependencies.
- `requirements_dev.txt`: Development-specific dependencies.
- `setup.py`: Python package setup script.
- `setup.cfg`: Configuration for package distribution.
- `pyproject.toml`: Project metadata.
- `tox.ini`: Configuration for testing environments.
- `research/`: Research-related files, including a Jupyter Notebook for experiments (`trials.ipynb`).


## Features

- **Effortless Project Initialization**: With a single command, you can quickly create the foundational structure for your projects, eliminating the need to set up directories and files manually.
